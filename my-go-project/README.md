# HTTP based application to demostrate use of optimised Dockerfiles

## How to run this application

###### Using Roost Desktop Engine (RDE)

> Right-click on `Makefile` and click `Run` for hassle-free deployment to ZKE

> What all is done by `make`?

* Cleans existing deployment [k8s-deployment.yaml](./k8s-deployment.yaml)

* Removes the application binary (if exists) [app](app)

* Builds an executable by compiling this codebase [main.go](./main.go)

* Builds an image using the app binary [make.Dockerfile](./make.Dockerfile)

* Deploys the image to ZKE Cluster [k8s-deployment.yaml](./k8s-deployment.yaml)

## View application logs

> Using `Workload Analytics` (RDE) for deployed application

> [RDE Workload Analytics image](show_GoogleBookAPI_pod_logs_and_workload_view) (to be added)

> Using RKT Konsole

```bash
kubectl logs service/myapp
```

## How to access app
